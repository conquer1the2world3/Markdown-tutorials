# Hello-World
Let us start learning how to use Markdown.

Here we will learn the syntax at first.
## Header
Use the character '#' to start a header.

##### e.g.    
#### THis is a header tag
## Emphasis
There are two ways to emphasize words:bold and italic.

italic: Wrap the sentence with a pair of * * or _ _

##### e.g.
*italic* or _italic_

bold:Wrap the sentence with a pair of ** **  

##### e.g. 
**the text will be bold**

You can also use them in combination.
##### e.g.
_A italic sentence with **bold word**_
